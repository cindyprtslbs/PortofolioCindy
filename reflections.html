                        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                        <p>
                            When I first entered Universitas Airlangga as an Informatics Engineering student in 2023, I was both excited and nervous. Coming from a MIPA background in high school, I had basic knowledge of mathematics and logic, but the world of programming and software development was relatively new to me. The first semester was challenging as I learned to think algorithmically and understand the fundamentals of computer science.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="reflection-card">
                        <div class="reflection-icon">
                            <i class="fas fa-mountain"></i>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Challenges & Growth</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of my biggest challenges was learning multiple programming languages simultaneously—Java, Python, PHP, and later Dart for Flutter development. Each language had its own syntax and paradigms, which sometimes felt overwhelming. However, this challenge taught me that the core concepts of programming are universal; once you understand the logic, switching between languages becomes easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another significant challenge was balancing my organizational responsibilities with academic work. As a staff member in HIMA D4 Teknik Informatika and IKAMABA UNAIR, I had to manage my time effectively between tutoring programs, event planning, and my coursework. This experience taught me valuable lessons in time management, teamwork, and leadership.

                    <div class="reflection-card">
                        <div class="reflection-icon">
                            <i class="fas fa-star"></i>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Highlights & Achievements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some of my proudest moments include completing the StayNest hotel reservation system using Laravel, which was my first full-stack web application. Seeing a project go from concept to a working system was incredibly rewarding. Another highlight was designing the EasyStay app prototype in Figma, which helped me realize my passion for UI/UX design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being part of the organizing committee for Teknovistafest was also a memorable experience. Working with a team to execute a successful web design competition involving participants from various universities taught me the importance of collaboration and attention to detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Earning certifications in UI/UX Design with Figma, Kotlin Development, and Junior Mobile Programming validated my skills and motivated me to continue learning. These courses not only enhanced my technical abilities but also exposed me to industry best practices.

                        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                        <p>
                            As I continue my journey at Universitas Airlangga, I'm excited about exploring more advanced topics in software engineering, particularly in areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and system design. I want to work on projects that have real-world impact and contribute to solving meaningful problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can handle both frontend and backend development, with a strong understanding of user experience principles. I believe that the combination of technical skills and design thinking is crucial for creating digital products that truly serve users' needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm grateful for the supportive community at Universitas Airlangga—my professors, peers, and organizational colleagues—who have helped me grow both personally and professionally. The journey has just begun, and I'm eager to see where it leads.
                        </p>
